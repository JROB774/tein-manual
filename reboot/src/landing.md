Welcome to The End is Nigh: Modder's Manual!

This manual plans to detail modding for The End is Nigh, providing help and information in
a variety of different areas. Hopefully helping new modders begin learning and understanding
the basics, as well as acting as a helpful reference for those more experienced.
There are three main sections to the manual:

    + Getting started/tutorials
    + Using the editor
    + The reference

Each main category is split into easier to digest chunks. Another useful part of the manual is the Downloads section, which supplies useful tools to allow for modding The End is Nigh.
