# Platform Physics

Location in the unpacked data: ```data\platformphysics.txt```

The platform physics file defines a variety of different variables relating
specifically to how the various movement tag tiles will move tiles aroud levels.
The speeds for each tile type can be set from within this file, which contains
the following variables:

- **MovingPlatformSpeedLow** - The speed at which tags F8-G1 move tiles.
- **MovingPlatformSpeedMed** - The speed at which tags G2-G5 move tiles.
- **MovingPlatformSpeedHigh** - The speed at which tags G6-G9 move tiles.
- **SmoothMovingPlatformSpeedXSlow** - The speed at which tags N2-N5 move tiles.
- **SmoothMovingPlatformSpeedLow** - The speed at which tags ID-I5 move tiles.
- **SmoothMovingPlatformSpeedMed** - The speed at which tags I6-I9 move tiles.
- **SmoothMovingPlatformSpeedHigh** - The speed at which tags J0-J3 move tiles.
- **FallingPlatformGravityLow** - The speed at which tag F2 makes tiles fall.
- **FallingPlatformGravityMed** - The speed at which tag F3 makes tiles fall.
- **FallingPlatformGravityHigh** - The speed at which tag F4 makes tiles fall.
- **WeightedPlatformSpeedSlow** - The speed at which tag L7 makes tiles move.
- **WeightedPlatformSpeedMed** - The speed at which tag L8 makes tiles move.
- **WeightedPlatformSpeedHigh** - The speed at which tag L9 makes tiles move.
- **SmasherSpeedLow** - No effect.
- **SmasherSpeedMed** - No effect.
- **SmasherSpeedHigh** - No effect.
- **SmasherDelayLow** - No effect.
- **SmasherDelayMed** - No effect.
- **SmasherDelayHigh** - No effect.
