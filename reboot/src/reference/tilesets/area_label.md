# Area Label Frame
Area Label Frame

The area label is the unique graphic that appears on screen whenever a new area
is entered. The area label frame variable refers to a specific frame of the area
label symbol, located inside the game’s SWF, informing the game which graphic to
render--basically acting as an ID for each graphic. Below is a list detailing
what frame holds each graphic, and some examples of area labels on the right:

- 00 - No Area Label
- 01 - The End
- 02 - Arid Flats
- 03 - Overflow
- 04 - The Split
- 05 - Wall of Sorrow
- 06 - SS Exodus
- 07 - Retrograde
- 08 - The Machine
- 09 - The Hollows
- 10 - Golgotha
- 11 - Anguish
- 12 - Gloom
- 13 - Blight
- 14 - Ruin
