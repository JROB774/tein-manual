# Sound IDs
The ```sound_id``` variable is used to define the sound played when the NPC is
spoken to and when text is advanced. The available sound IDs are as follows (the
values in brackets mark what sound file each sound ID references):

```
NPCSkull (audio\sfx\skullnpc.wav)
NPCBlob (audio\sfx\squishnpc.wav)
NPCGhost (audio\sfx\ghostnpc.wav)
NPCIsaac (audio\sfx\isaacnpc.wav)
NPCStevenCameo (audio\sfx\stevenheadwarpnpc.wav)
NPCGish (audio\sfx\gishnpc.wav)
NPCGuppy (audio\sfx\catnpc.wav)
NPCAether (audio\sfx\aethernpc.wav)
NPCSteven (audio\sfx\stevennpc.wav)
```

New sounds can be created by modifying ```mainsounds.txt``` and 
```retrosounds.txt```; see the section Sounds for more information on
creating new sounds.
