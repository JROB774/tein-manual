# Adding Art Alts

Adding art alts. can be done by modifying the gameâ€™s SWF. Making art alts.
requires an understanding of existing art alts. so that frame and layer patterns
can be replicated correctly based on what is being created (e.g. all tilesets
require the same basic layout, just different graphics). Once the graphics have
been developed, AS (ActionScript) linkage must be applied to that the game has a
name it can use to reference the asset, just like with the other art alts.

[UNDER DEVELOPMENT: Current information is bare-bones and will be updated with
more detail in a future update.]
