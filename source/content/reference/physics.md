# Physics

The various physics files define a variety of variables/values that can be
redefined to control the physics of the game. Note that this effects the game on
a global scale and cannot be defined to only impact specific areas. Modifying the
different physics files can lead to some drastic changes to gameplay and can even
create entirely new methods of play, making it an extremely powerful modding tool.

The physics files are split into two main categories: player physics, which
defines variables directly relating to the control and feel of the player; and
platform physics, which defines variables controlling how the various tag
movement tiles move tiles/entities.
