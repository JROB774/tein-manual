# Toxic Timer

The ```toxic_timer``` variable specifies how long it takes for toxic clouds and
water to kill the player, in seconds. This variable allows for values containing
a decimal-point. If the toxic timer is not specified the default time given is
within 1.8 to 2.0 seconds (this is a rough approximation).
