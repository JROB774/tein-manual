# Remarks
Art alts are used and referenced in a variety of different files to add graphics
to certain entities within the game. These files are as follows: 
[```data\npcs.txt```](../npcs/npcs.md), [```data\tilesets.txt```](../tilesets.md),
and ```data\particles.txt```.
Clicking on any of these filenames will take you to their respective pages
for more information (particles not yet available).

Not all art alts. will work in a usable fashion and be compatible with one
another. A good example being any of the tilesets which, if applied to something
like an NPC, will simply display all of its individual tile graphics in rapid
succession. Noting down all of these potential incompatibilities would be far
too large and complex of a list, so trial-and-error, as well as practice, is
the best method for figuring out what will and will not work.

If the game crashes with an error referring to a movie clip not being found, it
is most likely due to an art alt. being named incorrectly in one of the files
referenced above.
