All of the tiles within the resulting rectangle they create will be visible to the player when in the level, and anything outside will be out of the camera&#8217;s sights. If there are more than two camera bounds tiles in a level, the game will simply pick the two camera bounds that form the largest rectangle. It is considered good practice to make the resulting camera boudaries have approximately an 8:5 tile ratio inside
